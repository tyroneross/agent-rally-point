# Signed Rally Events

This documents the Rust signing path for Rally coordination events.

## Goal

Rally should remain local-first and append-only, while giving consumers a way to
answer:

- who produced this event?
- was the event modified after publication?
- is this producer trusted for this event kind?
- can this event safely participate in sync, Herdr injection, or automated
  decision-making?

Signing is not for secrecy. Rally events are still readable JSONL records.
Signing is for integrity, provenance, and trust policy.

## Non-goals

- No daemon or server requirement.
- No global identity provider requirement.
- No mandatory signing for legacy records.
- No encryption in the first signing layer.
- No attempt to prove that the human approved the event unless a separate
  human-approval event is signed by a trusted human identity.

## Threat model

Signing should detect or constrain:

1. **Tampering** — a record in `changes.jsonl` was edited after append.
2. **Producer spoofing** — an event claims `tool=codex` but was not signed by a
   key trusted for Codex.
3. **Causal forgery visibility** — an event claims a `thread_id`,
   `correlation_id`, or `causation_id` that gives it false authority or
   lineage. Signing makes that claim attributable; verifier policy still has to
   decide whether the producer is allowed to attach to that thread or parent.
4. **Sync injection** — a remote or copied channel introduces events from
   unknown producers.
5. **Herdr prompt injection escalation** — a handoff payload becomes live agent
   input through `rally herdr inject`; operators should know whether the handoff
   is trusted before injection.

Signing cannot prove that an LLM's statement is true. It also cannot prove that
a claimed causal relationship is semantically valid. It only proves which key
signed the event bytes and whether local policy trusts that key for the action.

## Event canonicalization

A signature covers the canonical portable event envelope, including `payload`
and causal metadata. It does not cover local store metadata.

The signed material MUST include:

- `specversion`
- `id`
- `source`
- `subject`
- `time`
- `kind`
- `type`
- `tool`
- `model`
- `run_id`
- `app_slug`
- `thread_id`
- `causation_id`
- `correlation_id`
- `datacontenttype`
- `dataschema`
- `payload`

The signed material MUST NOT include:

- the signature object itself
- local append metadata such as `revision`, `local_seq`, `received_at`, or
  `origin`
- import/sync bookkeeping metadata

This split is required for remote-safe identity. A Python flat record may carry
`revision` beside the event fields, and a future Rust store entry may wrap the
same event as `{ "event": { ... }, "local_seq": 12, ... }`. Both shapes must
produce the same canonical event bytes for the same portable event.

Canonical JSON rules for v1:

- UTF-8 JSON object
- sorted object keys
- no insignificant whitespace
- shortest JSON separators: `,` and `:`
- preserve JSON value types exactly
- reject non-finite floats if they appear in payloads

This is **Rally's canonical JSON v1**, not RFC 8785/JCS. It is deliberately
versioned so a future profile can introduce `rally-json-v2` if cross-language
byte equivalence needs a stricter canonicalization profile.

Reference shape:

```text
canonical_event = unwrap_store_entry(record)
remove canonical_event.signature
remove local metadata fields from the portable event:
  revision, local_seq, received_at, origin, imported_at, store, sync
serialize JSON with sorted object keys, UTF-8 strings, and compact separators
```

This canonicalization is intentionally small: strings are encoded as UTF-8
rather than ASCII escape sequences. If cross-language edge cases appear, Rally
can introduce
`signature.canonicalization = "rally-json-v2"` without changing older records.

## Signature envelope

A signed event adds one top-level `signature` object:

```json
{
  "signature": {
    "version": "rally-signature-v1",
    "algorithm": "ed25519",
    "key_id": "key_7f3...",
    "signed_at": "2026-05-26T18:00:00.000Z",
    "signature": "base64..."
  }
}
```

`key_id` is a stable local identifier for the public key, not a global account
name. Recommended v1 shape: `key_` plus the first 16 lowercase hex characters
of `sha256(public_key_bytes)`. Trust policy maps key ids to producers and
capabilities.

## Identity and key storage

Initial implementation should use local key material only:

```text
~/.agent-rally-point/identity/
  keys/<key_id>.pub
  private/<key_id>.key        # mode 0600, never synced by Rally
  trust.toml
```

A later implementation may use platform keychains. The file layout keeps the
first version inspectable and portable.

Recommended algorithm: Ed25519, implemented by the Rust trust layer. Do not
invent custom crypto.

## Trust policy

Trust is local policy, not a fact inside the event.

Example:

```toml
[[keys]]
key_id = "key_pi_local"
public_key = "base64..."
trusted_tools = ["pi"]
allowed_kinds = ["handoff", "claim", "blocker", "ack"]

[[keys]]
key_id = "key_codex_local"
public_key = "base64..."
trusted_tools = ["codex"]
allowed_kinds = ["ack", "feedback", "claim", "claim-release"]
```

A verifier combines signature validity plus policy:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `trusted` | signature valid; key known; policy permits `tool` + `kind` |
| `valid-untrusted` | signature valid, but key/policy is not trusted for this event |
| `unsigned` | no signature object; accepted for legacy compatibility |
| `invalid` | signature object exists but verification fails |
| `unknown-key` | key id is not present in local trust policy |
| `unsupported` | algorithm or canonicalization is unsupported |

Default behavior for local-only commands should be warn-not-drop. Commands that
escalate event content into agent input, sync, or automation may require
`trusted` or an explicit `--allow-untrusted` flag.

## CLI surface

Rust CLI:

```bash
rally verify [--json] [--trust-policy <trust.toml>] [--no-default-trust-policy] <changes.jsonl>
rally identity init --tool <tool> [--identity-dir <dir>] [--json]
rally handoff --sign --channel-dir <dir> --identity-dir <dir> ...
```

`rally verify` reads a `changes.jsonl` trace and reports signature/trust
classification without changing the trace. By default it loads
`~/.agent-rally-point/identity/trust.toml` when that file exists. Pass
`--trust-policy` to use an explicit policy file, or
`--no-default-trust-policy` to verify signatures without local policy.

JSON mode is the agent-facing contract:

```json
{
  "records": 3,
  "trust_policy": "/Users/me/.agent-rally-point/identity/trust.toml",
  "counts": {
    "trusted": 1,
    "unsigned": 2
  },
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "evt_345ea9b74be3461b9473e0cf80a79d40",
      "status": "trusted",
      "key_id": "key_codex_local"
    }
  ]
}
```

Identity commands:

```bash
rally identity init --tool pi
rally verify
rally verify --json
```

Rust write commands support sign-on-write:

```bash
rally handoff --sign ...
rally claim --sign ...
```

Signing is optional for local-only coordination so downstream tools can continue
to consume unsigned legacy events during the Rust cutover.

## Herdr policy

`rally herdr inject <handoff-id>` should eventually print trust state before
injection. In strict mode it should refuse to inject unsigned/invalid/unknown-key
handoffs unless explicitly overridden.

Prompt injection is a semantic risk even for trusted events. Signing tells the
operator who produced the payload; it does not make the payload safe.

## Sync policy

Signed events make future sync viable because a receiving channel can merge
unknown events without blindly trusting them.

Minimum sync behavior:

- preserve signatures byte-for-byte;
- never re-sign someone else's event as if it were local;
- verify before using remote events for automation;
- display untrusted remote events separately or with warnings;
- include signature status in `rally diagnose` when trust affects next actions.

Rust packet commands:

```bash
rally sync export --channel-dir <dir> --json > packet.json
rally sync import --channel-dir <dir> --trust-policy ~/.agent-rally-point/identity/trust.toml packet.json --json
```

## Open questions

- Should trust policy live only in `~/.agent-rally-point`, or can repos commit a
  suggested `.rally/trust.toml` that users import?
- Should unsigned local events be auto-trusted during a transition window?
- Should a human identity be distinct from tool identities?
- Should Rally sign individual records only, or also periodic checkpoints / log
  segments for faster tamper detection?
